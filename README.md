# Snake Hangman!

This project was developed to study for the SFWRENG 2XC3 final, but I had a lot of fun making it.

This command line interface game in c is designed to be a combination of snake and hangman. You are given a string to solve (initially all blanks). You must navigate (using standard wasd controls) around the map, and collect the appropriate letters as they spawn. Every time you collect a letter, others appear and disappear, so be wise with which letters you eat! Try to fill out your entire string without crashing into the wall!

## Usage:
To create the executable for this code, input the following functions in the root directory:
```
make
```
and then to start playing the game, ensure your terminal is big enough, and run:
```
./snake
```

Don't forget to have fun!
